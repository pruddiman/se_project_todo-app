# Simple Todo App

My project is a simple Todo app. It features a few things: The task, due date, and the option to check it off for completion or delete it entirely. The due date is optional for this app. It will display month, day, and year.

## Functionality

Create a ToDo task, give it an optional due date, and a description to indicate what task needs to be completed. It features a due date in month (short text abbreviation), day (numeric), and year (numeric). It offers a way to check it off, uncheck it, and delete it if necessary. It will update the total count of total tasks vs. completed tasks as you check off the boxes. In addition, it will also update when tasks are deleted.

## Technology

HTML, CSS, Git Bash, and Javascript were used to create this app. Javascript classes with constructors, private and public methods were used to create the functionality of this app. It was designed to be simplistic to allow for easy use of creating a new task without creating more code than necessary. In addition, the IDs are randomly generated and unique to each task preventing any conflicts or errors in the code.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
